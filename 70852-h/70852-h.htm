<p><i>A Chinese Studio with windowed walls of woodwork
and oil-paper. At back of centre a dais, and
behind that a picture showing an interior opening
into a garden. In the foreground of the picture
appears a hanging lantern, and below it a
mandoline and a jar holding a spray of plum-blossom.
To the right of the stage a sliding door
opens into street: to the left stairs lead upward
to interior, forward of that a door also to
interior. It is morning: six or seven students
squat painting. Between every two of them is a
small stand for paint-pots, brushes, etc. All are
very lazy and desultory at their work: the only
industrious one is</i> <span class="smcap">Tikipu</span>, <i>who, in shabby menial
attire, grinds colours with weary persistence.
The students yawn, stretch, and whine; and
resume work in a perfunctory way at intervals
upon shop-signs, lanterns, etc. On the dais sits</i>
<span class="smcap">Yunglangtsi</span>, <i>a mountain of indolent fat: sunk<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</span>
in profound slumber he squats before his easel.

why they should be marrying him to <i>her</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Han.</span> Why not?</p>

who couldn’t even speak the language! And
what is she now?—future bride of the incomparable
Mr. Yunglangtsi, who sits there awaiting the
fulfilment of his starry destiny—the Oracle which
announces that he is to become the greatest of
living artists.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lil.</span> Ugh! Olangtsi will have to be dead by
then.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hiti.</span> Oh no! Tiring of his exalted capacities
he will hand them on to Yunglangtsi. It will
be the occasion for a fresh lecture, as thus:
‘Gentlemen-pupils, apprentices, and paid workmen....’</p>

ancient Masters, whose only surviving representative
and follower I am—’ (At the word ‘am’ the complete
Kow-tow is necessary), ‘and whose last and

the Muses,” here hangs before you for your instruction.’

that picture, was old and tired of life, and he
longed for rest.... So he painted a little porch,
and a garden; and in the porch just one spray of
blossom in an old blue jar to remind him of youth,
an instrument of music to remind him of song, and
overhead a lantern to give light when it grew
dark.... And when the picture was done the
Emperor himself came to look at it.... And,
as he looked, he said: ‘Oh, Wiowani, in there,
it seems to me, is rest! Would that you and I
could go and live in a place like that for ever!’</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Han.</span> That’s a stupid story, you know. What business
has a picture with any perspective? You might as
well talk of walking into a piece of music as walking
into a picture!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hiti.</span> Ah! you are an old-fashioned purist, Han-Kin.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Han.</span> I’m not: I am simply a scientist. Latest
science says that you can’t tell whether a thing is
flat or round at twenty feet distance from the eye.
Stereoscopic sight is a mere accident, and only means
that you have got too close to an object to treat it
artistically. Paint your foregrounds as if they were
twenty feet away, and keep your distances as flat
as the palm of your hand,—and there you have art
and science rolled into one!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tee.</span> Ah, Han-Kin has been reading the old legend—the
oldest of all—and he calls himself a scientist!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Han.</span> What old legend?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tee.</span> How the gods of the first creation made everything
flat, and put it into a picture-book which they
called the Book of Life, so that they could just
turn over the leaves and amuse themselves without
any trouble.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lil.</span> Yes,—and then one day they left it out in the
rain, and it got wet and began to push out of
bounds, and grow and swell in all directions. And
so we got the world as it is—full of ups and downs,
and behinds and befores, and corners that you can’t
see round. Horrible, untidy, disgusting!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">New.</span> Well, but what can an artist do? He must
copy it!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lil.</span> Copy it! Where does Repeating-pattern find
art in that? Mere pig on pork <i>I</i> call it. What
art has to do is—put things back into shape as the
gods originally intended. Make your picture submissively
flat—and there you’ve got religious art.
A picture that looks as if you could walk into it
makes me sick. Who <i>wants</i> to walk into it?
Wiowani was an exalted ass to my thinking.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hiti.</span> Any way he wasn’t an impressionist, that’s
one comfort.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tee.</span> If a symbolist,—green flesh and brown trees. If
you are a vibrantist you see spots, if a chiaroscurist
you see blots, if you are academic you use hard

<p><span class="smcap">Lil.</span> No, I don’t!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hiti.</span> Yes, he does!</p>

D’you know what I was? [<i>She shakes her head.</i>]
A grocer! I suppose you don’t know what that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>
means? Well, it means sitting in a great shop
where people come to buy, and giving orders to
everybody. And all round you there are barrels
of oil, with taps that run, and casks of sugar, and
tea by the ton; and bins of rice, and boxes of spice,
and everything nice as nice can be! And a crushing-machine
where things are ground, and the samples
all have a different sound. And you plunge your
arms in flour or meal; and if you can’t see what it
is—<i>you can feel</i>!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mee.</span> Oh! how beautiful!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Yung.</span> And soap, Mee-Mee! Oh, there’s a fortune
to be made out of soap alone. There was a man
once, Mee-Mee, who spent three years inventing
the name of a soap.... And when he’d invented
it he turned it into a syndicate and sold it. He
sold it for twenty thousand yen.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mee.</span> De <i>name</i>?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Yung.</span> Yes, the name. What the soap was didn’t
matter so long as it had a good name. That’s

means.... That’s what <i>I</i> was once!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mee.</span> You? Oh, poo’ man, to lose all dat!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Yung.</span> Yes, I’d got my full grocer’s certificate: I’d
taken five years to earn it, and I was so proud of
it! I used to wear it round my neck so that every
one could see.... It had white letters on a red
ground—and it said ... [<i>he breaks down</i>]. And<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>
all because of you and your Star, they’ve gone and
taken it off me!... I tell you they’d given up
trying to turn me into an artist: they’d found it
was no good. And then <i>you</i> came, you, you, you
superfluous little pig!—and now I’ve got to wait
till your beastly Star comes round again—three
years,—and then I’ve got to marry you and become
a fool of a painter, when I might have been a grocer
if you’d only stayed away!</p>

hear? Kick, bite, scratch; only mind you
don’t tear the dress! Do it decently: give one of
them a scratch on his face where it can be seen:
that’ll be enough. If you show too much fight it
looks like having too high an opinion of yourself.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
